      "SECURITY\n",
      "     Certain security issues are common to many archiving programs, including\n",
      "     tar.  In particular, carefully-crafted archives can request that tar\n",
      "     extract files to locations outside of the target directory.  This can\n",

      "     not intend to overwrite.  If the archive is being extracted by the supe-\n",
      "     ruser, any file on the system can potentially be overwritten.  There are\n",
      "     three ways this can happen.  Although tar has mechanisms to protect\n",
      "     against each one, savvy users should be aware of the implications:\n",
      "\n",
      "     o       Archive entries can have absolute pathnames.  By default, tar\n",
      "             removes the leading / character from filenames before restoring\n",
      "             them to guard against this problem.\n",

      "     o       Archive entries can have pathnames that include .. components.\n",
      "             By default, tar will not extract files containing .. components\n",
      "             in their pathname.\n",
      "\n",
      "     o       Archive entries can exploit symbolic links to restore files to\n",

      "             directory.  To guard against this, tar checks each extracted path\n",

      "             removed and replaced with the archive entry.  If -U is specified,\n",

      "HISTORY\n",
      "     A tar command appeared in Seventh Edition Unix, which was released in\n",
      "     January, 1979.  There have been numerous other implementations, many of\n",
      "     which extended the file format.  John Gilmore's pdtar public-domain\n",
      "     implementation (circa November, 1987) was quite influential, and formed\n",
      "     the basis of GNU tar.  GNU tar was included as the standard system tar in\n",
      "     FreeBSD beginning with FreeBSD 1.0.\n",
      "\n",
      "     This is a complete re-implementation based on the libarchive(3) library.\n",
      "     It was first released with FreeBSD 5.4 in May, 2005.\n",
      "\n",
      "BUGS\n",
      "     This program follows ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996 (``POSIX.1'') for the definition\n",
      "     of the -l option.  Note that GNU tar prior to version 1.15 treated -l as\n",
      "     a synonym for the --one-file-system option.\n",
      "\n",
      "     The -C dir option may differ from historic implementations.\n",

      "     a full block size if the output is being written to standard output or to\n",
      "     a character or block device such as a tape drive.  If the output is being\n",

      "\n",
      "     The r and u modes require that the archive be uncompressed and located in\n",
